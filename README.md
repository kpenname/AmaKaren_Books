A web app that connects people who love books with other people who love books.

This is a school project. Amaka and Karen will be collaborating on it in June 2020.

There is no licence included so that means no one else is allow to use our code.  
(But that's okay, we're just students, so why would you want to anyway, right?)

Amaka, try these instructions for getting this repo on your machine.

1.  On the main repo page, click on the green button "Clone or Download." Copy that address/url

2.  In VS code, create a folder for the project.

3.  Open a terminal and make sure you are working in that folder.

4.  Then type git clone url - where url is the address of the repo you copied.

5.  Switch to this new folder - cd AmaKaren_Books

6.  Type git status - to check that your local copy is the same as the remote repo.
    You should see "master -> master"

7.  Type npm i - to install the node_modules folder

8.  When you create a file, folder, or edit anything, you have to do three things.
    (Well four because you have to save in VScode first)

        a. git add theNameOfTheFile.changed   (this tells git what to add)
        b. git commit -m "description of the commit to appear in the repo"  (this saves the changes)
        c. git push  (this sends the saved changes to github)
